57) Given an array where every element occurs three times, except one element which occurs only once. Find the element that occurs once.ex: arr=12, 1, 12, 3, 12, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3. o/p: 2.

**Recursion:**

58) A boy can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.In how many ways he can climb n stairs?(Extension : print the paths).

60) Count the number of elements greater than the given element in an array.
61) Fibnocci series upto a given number.
62) Factorial of a given number.This problem was actually given to us to know about stack frame and it's size by infinty recurrsion i.e no base condition.
63) Given an array where elements in array becomes the parent node for child nodes which are their indices, find the maximum height*//*solution : since Height = Depth, calculating the depths of all nodes recursively , complexity = O(n).
